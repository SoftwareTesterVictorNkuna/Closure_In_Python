<h1>Decorators in Python</h1> 

<br/>
    The following small project demonstrate the concepts of closure in Python using small examples how they work and have some pytest to test the functionality of the decorator function as to whther are they working as expected.

<h2>Examples on how to  install requirements modules</h2>
<br/>

<strong>Install the project dependencies using $pip3 -venv <env_name>
,and do $pip3 install -r requirements.txt  to install listed project dependencies</strong>

<h3>Conceptual theory of decorator functions in Python</h3>
<br/>

<p>
    Decorators are evolved from the concept of closures, where  ,
    a decorator function is a high order functions that takes a function as an argument and returns inner function. 
        <ul>
        <li>A decorator is capable of adding extra functionality to an  exsting function without altering it
        </li>
        <li>The decorator function is prefixed with @ symbol and written above the function definition</li>
        </ul>
